# Recreating Google Home Page

 From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

 ## Objective

 Recreate the famous Google homepage using only HTML and CSS to the best of my ability.

 ## What I Learned

 Used Floating Unordered Lists to create a Navbar and Fixed Footer.

 Added in a script from fontawesome.com in order to use one of their icons in my Navbar.

 Used my Terminal on my Linux Desktop to add, commit, and push changes throughout this project.
